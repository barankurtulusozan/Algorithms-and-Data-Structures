# PY_00_Introduction

#Hello World,this line is a commment line
print("Hello World")

#Variable Declaration
a=2
#or Chained Variable Declaration
a=b=2

#Print number as a string expression
print("a= " + str(a)) # will print a= 2
hello="my name is earthling"
print("Hello "+ str(hello)) #will print Hello my name is earthling

#Display type of the variable
a = 5
print(type(a))    #will print class 'int'

b = 5.0
print(type(b))    ##will print class 'float'

number = 9
print(type(number))   # print type of variable "number"

#Type Conversion
float_number = 9.0
print(type(float_number))
print(type(int(float_number)))
#will change the type of float number to integer
#if we want to change its type to string 
#we can say str(variable)
print(type(str(float_number)))


#Result is 9/2 and the remainder is 9 modulo 2
number = 9.0        # float number
result = number/2
remainder = 9 % 2
print("result = " + str(result))
print("remainder = " + str(remainder))


# Lets say a=2 and we want to calculate a+2 and assign it to a again
#We can say 
a = a + 2
#Or
a+=2
#Two of them are same for Python

# Lets say a=2 and we want to calculate a*5
#We can say 
a = a * 5
#Or
a*=5


two = 2
three = 3
print(is_equal)
two*=three
print(str(two)) #will print 6

#Boolean Operators
is_equal = two == three # will print False

#Also we can express three is greater than two like
3 >= 2 # true
#Or two is less or equal than three
2 <= 3 # true







#\b backspace 
#\n New Line
#\t Tab
#\0 Null
#\r Carriage return
#\\ Prints \
#\' Prints '
#\" Prints "
