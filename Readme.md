# Data Structures And Algorithms with C C++ Python
----------------
> * Other Languages will be added in time

# PROJECT SCHEDULE
> * When I accomplish Project Goals for this Repo, I'll start creating repos about Data Analysis, Neural Networks, Machine Learning, etc. with Coding that can directly turn Computer Science Areas into practice (I know Internet has already done it, I'm talking about Tr supported practical codes) with the selected Core languages: C|C#|C++|Java|Python|JS
