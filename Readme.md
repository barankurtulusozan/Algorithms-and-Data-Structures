# Data Structures And Algorithms with C C++ Python
----------------
> * For Now , Completed Just C [%80], Python [%3] Other Languages will be added in time
> * I dont want to bulk load copy and paste , internet has done that already 
> * I know Intermediate Python and '0' C++ so i have to and will actually spend
> * some time to Learn Python and C++ on the way. 

# PROJECT SCHEDULE
> * 2015.04.07 Start: Python Data Structures
> * 2015.04.22 Start: Python Algorithms
> * 2015.05.05 Start: C++ Data Structures
> * 2015.05.26 Start: C++ Algorithms
> * 2015 Summer&Fall: C# and Java and maybe even with JS =)
> * Bonus: A website will be published with language support: Turkish & English [2016:+German]  

> * When I accomplish Project Goals for this Repo, I'll start creating repos about Data Analysis, Neural Networks, Machine Learning, etc. with Coding that can directly turn Computer Science Areas into practice (I know Internet has already done it, I'm talking about Tr supported practical codes) with the selected Core languages: C|C#|C++|Java|Python|JS


----------------






















> * 42: Note for Myself: Create a multiplatform alarm app (maybe with arm) for my own github scheduling.
